# AI Voice Assistant

An AI-powered voice assistant built using Python and Livekit that enables seamless voice-based interactions. This project aims to provide a robust platform for integrating voice recognition, text-to-speech, and task automation features.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Converts speech into text in real-time.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Responds to user commands with natural-sounding voice output.
- **Livekit Integration**: Enables low-latency, real-time communication for voice interactions using the Livekit server.
- **Task Automation**: Supports executing various tasks like setting reminders, fetching information, and more.
- **Customizable Skills**: Easily extend the assistantâ€™s capabilities to handle new commands and functionalities.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - SpeechRecognition (for voice input processing)
  - Pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech conversion)
  - Flask (for backend services)
- **Livekit**: For enabling real-time voice communication via a Livekit server.
- **Additional Tools**: Any other dependencies can be listed here.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.8 or above
- pip (Python package manager)
- A Livekit server setup with valid credentials and API keys

## Installation
